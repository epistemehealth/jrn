## Aims and Scope

The Journal for Reproducibility in Neuroscience publishes articles from attempts to replicate entire studies or single experiments. We aim to be a platform for sharing results that support or contradict articles that have already been published in the scientific literature of basic and applied neuroscience: anatomy, behavior, biochemistry, bioinformatics, cell biology, genetics, physiology and pharmacology. We also welcome commentaries, mini-reviews and articles on the topic of reproducibility in science.

## Peer Review

Authors can opt to have a single- or double-blinded review.

## Free Open Access
