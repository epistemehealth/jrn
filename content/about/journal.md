## Aims and Scope

The Journal for Reproducibility in Neuroscience publishes articles from attempts to replicate entire studies or single experiments. We aim to be a platform for sharing results that support or contradict articles that have already been published in the scientific literature of basic and applied neuroscience: anatomy, behavior, biochemistry, bioinformatics, cell biology, genetics, physiology and pharmacology. We also welcome commentaries, mini-reviews and articles on the topic of reproducibility in science.

## Peer Review

Authors can opt to have a single- or double-blinded review.

## Free Open Access

*No Fees or Charges*

There are no compulsory fees for authors or readers in this journal.

Authors do not have to pay submission fees, acceptance or article processing charges, withdrawal fees, page charges, or fees for figures or tables.

Readers do not have to register or subscribe in order to access content.

As a free open access journal, we have no intention of introducing publication or subscription fees for authors or readers.

*Copyright and Licensing*

Authors retain copyright and no restrictions are placed on the authors' own use of their work. Articles will be published under a licensing arrangement of the authors' choice, as outlined in the publisher's [Copyright and Fair Dealing policy](https://about.epistemehealth.com/policy/copyright-fair-dealing/).

## Reviewer Recognition

The journal has a profile on [Publons](https://publons.com/journal/801462/journal-for-reproducibility-in-neuroscience/) but it is currently not registered. Use of external commercial reviewer recognition services is optional.
