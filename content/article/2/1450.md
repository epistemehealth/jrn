abstract = "Reproducible research requires to dive into a wide range of subjects (e.g.: statistics, study design, scientific computing) that are quite far from French librarians practices and/or initial training. Librarians do have a technical expertise, but horror stories pinpoint that even seasoned experts seem to lose track. In such context, what could be the added value of librarians?"
